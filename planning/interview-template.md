## 1. First Interview

- The interview was on Monday at 13:00 PM.
- we discussed:
  - client's study, job, skills and experience.
  - main goals for the website that we are building.
  - User personas.
  - The date of the follow up interview.

<!--
  Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their ambitions. Ask questions about:

  - Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
  - And much more ... listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

  The best way to do your interview is with a lot of `why?`. Start your interview with one or two open-ended questions and follow up with a lot of `why?`, this gives your partner the chance to really explain themselves instead of just answering your questions. You might find that they even learn something about themselves!

## 3. Capture Findings

- finding what a client needs is not easy.
- sometimes we need more than 2 interviews with the client.
- writing ideas is not like visualizing them.

<!-- Take some time to consolidate & summarize what you learned in the previous two interviews. -->

### Needs

- she needs customers to find her, customers are 3 types:
  - people who want to change their lifestyles.
  - people who want to lose weight.
  - people who want to know more about workouts.

<!-- What exactly does your partner need from their home page? Are they looking for collaborators? A job?Learning opportunities? Or something you never expected? -->

### Insights

<!-- New learnings about your partner to use in your design -->

## 4. Define the Problem

- Nefn has arrived to Belgium one year ago. she was a gym coach in her country,
  she has 9 years of experience. she is looking to find more customers to join
  her classes or to coach the as a PT.
- these days, people are busy and maybe it is hard for them to join a gym or
  follow a specific class, so the website should be a nice way that introduce
  Nefen to customers, so they will be able to see her skills and availabe
  schedule for classes so each customer can choose a class that fits his free
  time.
- she wants the customers to be able to read about her and about the classes and
  be able to contact her to join her.
- she also wants customers to be able to read more about different workouts.

<!--
  In your own words describe:

  - Why does your partner need this home page?
  - How do they want to be represented?
  - Who do they want to visit their page?
  - What do they want different visitors to see them?

  A useful format:

  - _partner's name_ needs a way to _?_.
    - Unexpectedly, in their world, _?_.
-->

## 5. Open-Ended Ideation

I built 2 wireframes:

<!--
  Sketch up a few wireframes for your partner's home page with no regard for your their programming ability, time constraints, technical constraints, or any other practical considerations.
  How are the designs different? How does each one serve your partner differently?
-->

- [PT website](https://www.figma.com/file/ocNcFPeXSv8EbSZiDvWJEj/PT-website?node-id=0%3A1)
- [PT website 2](https://www.figma.com/file/j6OlS4bA54QO3i4RFd2z9f/PT-website-2?node-id=0%3A1)

- PT website has less pages with long paragraphs.
- PT website 2 has a side nav bar and short paragraphs and one more webpage.
